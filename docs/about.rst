About malstroem
===============

History
-------
The malstroem Project was initiated in November 2015 by SDFE who sponsored the development of a
cloudburst screening method to be carried out by Assoc. Prof. Thomas Balstrøm, Section of Geography &
Geoinformatics, Institute of Geosciences and Natural Resources, University of Copenhagen. The method
was implemented as models in ModelBuilder for ArcGIS Desktop 10.4 and documented in Balstrøm (2016,
submitted). In August 2016 SDFE asked Septima to implement Thomas’ method in a pure Python
environment based on open source technology, only, and by the end of December a first test version
programmed by Asger was available. It is this version, which is presented here.

The major difference in functionality is that the ArcGIS version was based on a transfer of derived
bluespots, watersheds and streams to ArcGIS’ geometric network environment, where the final outputs
describing the spill over in between bluespots was carried out by a custom script written in .Net and C#.
In Asger’s implementation the geometric network component was omitted.
